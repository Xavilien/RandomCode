#### Convert to PDF workflow
This is an automator workflow for MacOS that allows you to select multiple documents in finder before selecting the service to converting the files into PDF format with the same filename.

Files must either be Microsoft documents or powerpoint with the extension ".docx" or "pptx". Also, Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint must be installed on the Mac

Note: The original files will be moved to the trash after being converted
